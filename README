Modifications in samuellb's version
===================================

The original Unity does not work well when you want to use the same
applications in multiple workspaces. This modified version makes it behave
more like other DEs:

 * Clicking a launcher item in a new workspace always launches the application
   instead of switching back to the old workspace.
 * Launcher items are only visible in the workspaces where the application is
   running.
 * The animation when an item is added has been disabled. I find it more
   annoying than useful, and it also didn't play well with my modifications.


Compiling Unity 2D
==================

cmake . && make


Running
=======

./shell/app/unity-2d-shell
./panel/app/unity-2d-panel


Notes on the Dash
=================

The dash exposes a D-Bus property for activation and deactivation:

com.canonical.Unity2d /Dash com.canonical.Unity2d.Dash.active true|false
